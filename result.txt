I am currently connected to MTS Mblaze Ultra 3G+ Dongle having 14.7 mbps download and 3 mbps upload speed.
I am using Rasberry Pi !
The Raspberry Pi has a Broadcom BCM2835 system on a chip (SoC), which includes an ARM1176JZF-S 700 MHz processor, VideoCore IV GPU,and was originally shipped with 256 megabytes of RAM, later upgraded (Model B & Model B+) to 512 MB.
I am afraid, My botmasters won't allow that to happen!
I am developed using Python 2.7
I'm doing well. How about you?
Thanks.
I haven't been better.
Yes, How may I help you?
